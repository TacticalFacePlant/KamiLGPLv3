make sure to test with what ever cruel stuff people can do to the nbt data of a map i dont know if that glitches things

I don't know what that would be, but it shouldn't :p

ok good

so i have the pathfinder seperated from the rest of my mods now. i will send you a zip with a clone form my repo inside for starters.  i would like to cooperate on the development of the module / tenor / what ever you will do with it. how would be the best way to colaborate on this without wirteaccess on kami. my idea is  you could make a feature branch and i could work on a fork  and do a pull request for every bit of code i do. do you have any better ideas
dominika28/05/2020
I would be willing to give you write access to tenor, just give me a bit too look over at and I'll see how it works
also can you assure me that you have the full rights to the pathing code, and would be willing to license it under LGPL V3

not a big fan of their copy left but i guess its a must with baritone beeing lgpl v3 and i do have coded it myself.
